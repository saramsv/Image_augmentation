# Image_augmentation
This code is used to augment images along with their annotation files. The annotation for the data
set used here are rectangular annotations. The coordinates on the annotations are saved in a Json file and thus
whatever augmentation is done on an image, it needs to reflect on the Json file as well.<br/>
draw_bbox.py is used to draw the annotations on the images to visualy veify the augmnetation done on the annotations as well as the original images.
